# Rank Features of a Smartphone
### Build a Python Application to Classify and Rank Dataset

---

## üìÑ Abstract
Smartphones, despite robust authentication mechanisms, remain susceptible to fraudulent use. **Active authentication**, leveraging behavioral biometrics, can safeguard data privacy in smart devices. The efficacy of this approach relies heavily on the **relevance of training data** and efficient training times.

---

## üìä Dataset Overview
This dataset encompasses vital smartphone features, including:

- **Battery Power**: Total energy stored (mAh)
- **Clock Speed**: Microprocessor instruction execution speed
- **Dual SIM**: Dual SIM support
- **4G Support**: Availability of 4G connectivity
- **Internal Memory**: Storage capacity (GB)
- **RAM**: Random Access Memory (MB)
- **Price Range**: Target variable indicating cost levels (0-3)

## üì• Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from the **digital discussion room of the TCSiON learning platform**.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
**Objective**: Develop a Python application that classifies and ranks smartphone features based on dataset attributes.
